# EV-Adoption-and-Infrastructure-Analysis

## Project Overview

This project examines the adoption and infrastructure development of electric vehicles (EVs) across New York State and the United States, providing insights into legislation, charging infrastructure, rebates, and registration patterns. The analysis was conducted using Tableau, to uncover key trends and relationships within the data. The purpose of this project is to analyze and present key factors influencing EV adoption, infrastructure growth, and policy impact, providing stakeholders with actionable insights to promote sustainable transportation.

## Dashboard Analysis
### 1) EV Registrations:

In New York State, the top 500 ZIP codes for EV registrations are predominantly in urban centers like New York City, Albany, Syracuse, Rochester, and Buffalo, with Tesla leading as the top EV make followed by Toyota; Tesla experienced a sharp rise in registrations since 2018, reflecting its market dominance, though this trend saw a notable decline in 2024, indicating possible shifts in adoption patterns.

### 2) EV Infrastructure Distribution:
The concentration of EV charging infrastructure is along the U.S. coasts, highlighting California as the state with the highest number of fuel type stations, a remarkable 10x growth in EV infrastructure observed in 2024 compared to 2023, and a clear emphasis on public accessibility, with over 94% of charging stations being available for public use.

### 3) Market Trends and Regional Impact:
New York City counties, led by Suffolk County, have received the highest EV rebates in the state, with BEVs consistently surpassing PHEVs in rebates since 2019, and Tesla dominating as the top recipient, reflecting its market leadership and urban adoption focus.

### 4) Laws and Incentives:
Over the past 33 years, 990 EV legislations have been enacted across the U.S., with California leading at 97 laws, and a sharp increase in laws enacted for EVs since 2014 underscores the growing policy focus on promoting sustainable transportation and electric vehicle adoption.

## Conclusion
The analysis in this project sheds light on the critical factors driving electric vehicle adoption, including policy support, rebates, charging infrastructure, and regional registration trends. It highlights how proactive legislation, such as Californiaâ€™s leadership in EV laws, and financial incentives like higher BEV rebates, contribute to increased adoption. These insights provide a foundation for strategic planning to further promote sustainable transportation and enhance EV infrastructure.
